# /pm:task - Enhanced Task Management

## Triggers
- Complex tasks requiring multi-agent coordination and delegation
- Projects needing structured workflow management
- Operations requiring intelligent agent routing and domain expertise
- Tasks benefiting from systematic execution and progressive enhancement

## Usage
```
/pm:task [action] [target] [--strategy systematic|agile|enterprise] [--parallel] [--delegate]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Parse task requirements and determine optimal execution strategy
2. **Delegate**: Route to appropriate agents and activate relevant domain experts
3. **Coordinate**: Execute tasks with intelligent workflow management and parallel processing
4. **Validate**: Apply quality gates and comprehensive task completion verification
5. **Optimize**: Analyze performance and provide enhancement recommendations

Key behaviors:
- Agent coordination across architect, frontend-specialist, security-specialist, devops-engineer domains
- Intelligent agent routing based on task complexity and domain requirements
- Systematic execution with progressive task enhancement
- Advanced task delegation with hierarchical breakdown and dependency management

## Agent Coordination
- **architect**: System design, architecture patterns, technical planning
- **frontend-specialist**: UI/UX implementation and design system integration
- **security-specialist**: Security requirements and threat mitigation
- **devops-engineer**: Deployment, infrastructure, and operational concerns
- **test-engineer**: Testing strategies and quality assurance
- **database-expert**: Data modeling and query optimization
- **performance-engineer**: Performance optimization and bottleneck analysis

## Tool Coordination
- **TodoWrite**: Hierarchical task breakdown and progress tracking across Epic → Story → Task levels
- **Task**: Advanced delegation for complex multi-agent coordination and sub-task management
- **Read/Write/Edit**: Task documentation and implementation coordination
- **WebSearch**: Technology research and implementation strategy analysis
- **Bash**: System operations and validation

## Key Patterns
- **Task Hierarchy**: Epic-level objectives → Story coordination → Task execution → Subtask granularity
- **Strategy Selection**: Systematic (comprehensive) → Agile (iterative) → Enterprise (governance)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Agent activation → domain routing → parallel execution → result integration
- **Progressive Management**: Task persistence → context continuity → systematic enhancement

## Examples

### Complex Feature Development
```
/pm:task create "enterprise authentication system" --strategy systematic --parallel
# Comprehensive task breakdown with multi-domain coordination
# Activates architect, security-specialist, and frontend-specialist agents
```

### Agile Sprint Coordination
```
/pm:task execute "feature backlog" --strategy agile --delegate
# Iterative task execution with intelligent delegation
# Systematic progress tracking and quality gates
```

### Multi-Domain Integration
```
/pm:task execute "microservices platform" --strategy enterprise --parallel
# Enterprise-scale coordination with compliance validation
# Parallel execution across multiple technical domains
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Execute complex tasks with multi-agent coordination and intelligent delegation
- Provide hierarchical task breakdown with systematic progress tracking
- Coordinate multiple agents for optimal task outcomes

**Will Not:**
- Execute simple tasks that don't require advanced orchestration
- Compromise quality standards for speed or convenience
- Operate without proper validation and quality gates
