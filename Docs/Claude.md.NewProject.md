# CLAUDE.md

This will contain info that will need to be added to the new Claude.md file when a project is started with this template

**CRITICAL: NO CODING IS ALLOWED UNTIL PHASE 2. The user will explicitly indicate when Phase 1 is complete**

**When working on an item that will require a status update in the Claude.md file, make that update in the claude.md if it changed so future context won't do duplicate work**

**Always ask question if unsure about what to do. If more than 4 questions, create a file in the Docs\WIP folder and ask me to answer those questions there.**

**Considering that we use the Claude.code Pro account, which has limits that can run out, save work onto there documents as soon as it is done, so you don't run out of limits and then have not saved the document for work already completed.**

**Using the installed docs-rag MCP server, reindex_docs() everytime after a commit that changed the Docs, if it's a big enough commit to make sense (i.e not a single bug fix)**

**For committing to github, I will do the push, so you can commit.**

**Very important, we've installed a local RAG MCP server called "docs-rag". All /Docs documents are indexed on it. Use it to search to safe on Context**
